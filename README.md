# Bot to be Wild: A Franka Emika Panda (FR3) Robotics Adventure

**Bot to be Wild: A robotics learning adventure with a Franka Panda, where the only limit is our imagination (and maybe the robot's joint limits).**

## Project Overview

Welcome to "Bot to be Wild," our team's hands-on journey into the world of robotics using the **Franka Emika Panda (Research 3)** robot! We're diving headfirst into this project to learn about **ROS 2**, **Isaac Sim**, and the intricacies of controlling this advanced collaborative robot. We believe in learning by doing, so we'll be tackling challenges, experimenting with code, and documenting our progress along the way.

## Project Goals

*   **Master the Franka Emika Panda:** Gain a deep understanding of the robot's capabilities and how to control it effectively.
*   **Become ROS 2 Proficient:**  Develop a solid foundation in using ROS 2 as the framework for our robot applications.
*   **Explore Simulation with Isaac Sim:** Leverage NVIDIA's Isaac Sim to create realistic simulations for testing and developing our robot control strategies.
*   **Document Our Journey:**  Share our learning process, including successes, failures, and insights, to help others on their robotics adventures.

## Current Milestone

*   **[Completed]**  Successfully integrated the `franka_ros2` package with ROS 2 and MoveIt! We can now visualize the Franka robot in RViz and perform basic motion planning.

## Next Steps

*   **Implement advanced control algorithms.**
*   **Set up a simulated environment in Isaac Sim.**
*   **Integrate real-world robot control with the Isaac Sim simulation.**
*   **Develop a sample application that showcases the robot's capabilities.**

## Documentation

We're keeping track of our setup process, code examples, and lessons learned. the first milestone is documented in the `Installation Guide.md` file. These documents will serve as a valuable resource for our team and anyone else interested in working with the Franka Emika Panda.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need:

1. A Franka Emika Panda (Research 3) robot (or access to one) for physical demos.
2. A computer with ROS 2 (Humble) installed.
3. Familiarity with basic Linux command-line operations.
4. A willingness to learn, experiment, and embrace the occasional robot-induced challenge!

Refer to the `Installation Guide.md` file for detailed installation instructions and setup guides.

## Let's Get Wild!

We're excited to embark on this robotics adventure and see what we can achieve with the Franka Emika Panda. Stay tuned for updates, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or want to join the fun!
